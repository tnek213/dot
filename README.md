## About the Repository

The dotfiles in this collection are tailored to my specific setup but are shared in case they're helpful to someone else in the spirit of openness.

### Chezmoi

I use the excellent tool [chezmoi][1] to manage my dotfiles across multiple machines to keep them synchronized and up-to-date.

## Contributing

As these configuration files are custom made to fit my needs I'm not interested in broadening them to fit other peoples needs.
